## üìî Notes
This configuration would probably only work on Dell branded PCs with 8th or 9th Gen Intel Core CPU only. Feel free to download or fork this repository to make your own version from this configuration.

> All ACPI Patches are made from following Dortania's OpenCore ACPI Patching Guide with Manual Method found here: [Link](https://dortania.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/)

> I am not going to support any beta version of MacOS. So, Released Version Only!

> I've removed the dedicated NVIDIA GPU as Dell motherboards tend to disable their display ports when there's a GPU plugged in.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardwase
I've changed the internal WiFi & Bluetooth Card to a compatible Intel WiFi Card for compatibility and future-proofing as Broadcom Cards are less-preferred going forward from Sonoma.
